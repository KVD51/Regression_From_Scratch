Regression_From_Scratch.py is a program that will fit a regression line to a set of x,y values. The program does not use the Skikit-learn LinearRegression function.

Slope and intercept gradients are calculated and used to iterate through possible slope and intercept values until the best values are found. A regression line is plotted based on the best slope and intercept values. The purpose is to illustrate knowledge of regression analysis.

A set of data points are provided within the code. Try changing the values to plot a different regression line fit to the values.

Matplotlib is used to plot the data points as well as the regression line.
