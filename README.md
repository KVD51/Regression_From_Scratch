Regression_From_Scratch.py is a program that will fit a regression line to a set of x,y values. The program does not use the Skikit-learn LinearRegression function.

A set of data points are provided within the code. Try changing the values to sit a different regression line fit to the values.

Matplotlib is used to plot the data points as well as the regression line.
